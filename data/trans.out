But the cat sitting on the outside wall was not sleepy.
He sat motionless, his eyes unblinking at the corner of Privet Drive.
It does not move even when there is a door slamming across the street.
Do not budge even when two owls flutter over the top.
And it was almost midnight that the cat moved.
It was when an old man appeared at the corner where the cat was looking.
He appeared suddenly and quietly as if from the ground up, the tail of the cat waved and his eyes narrowed.
There has never been a bizarre look on Privet Drive ever since.
Sick, tall, very old, based on the hair and beard so long that they have to hold them back.
He wore long sleeves and a long purple sweater, though he wore laced boots, his blue eyes gleaming and glittering behind the spectacles of moonlight. .
The nose is just as long as the nose has broken at least twice.
